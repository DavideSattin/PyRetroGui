Panel Behaviour

    Create the Panel Behaviour class, which encapsulates all panel-related information, including:

    size
    layout/disposition

Control Factory
    Currently, the UI factory logic is delegated to the application class.
    This responsibility should be extracted into a dedicated singleton Control Factory.
    The factory will provide a simpler and more direct access point for creating UI controls, avoiding the need to access the application container object.
    The singleton factory will also be responsible for tracking and storing all generated control IDs.

 DONE
    Create the class for VideoLogicBuffer
